## Approach
The resouces were really helpful.
I set the project up and cloned the git repo with `assests` folder into the system.
To access the pixalated images I copied the path to `assests` folder.
The images are then sorted by their names to ensure theyâ€™re processed in the correct order. Each image is checked for dots by converting it to grayscale and detecting shapes. 
The center of each dot is found, and lines are drawn between these centers on a blank canvas. 
Finally, the completed image, showing the connected dots and revealing the Logo, is saved and displayed.
