This file is details about my journey to victory.

### Part 1:
I found the first code with ease.
Three new commands that I learnt:
- `tree`: gives the structure of the directories and subdirectories of the main directory
- `find`: searches the directories and subdirectories and tells you the exact location of the file
- `cat`: reads the contents of a txt/sh files
### Part 2:
This is where I got stuck and boy it was frustrating.
One new command that I learnt:
- `grep`: using `grep -rl` gives you the names of files with the given word in command
If it would have been one word, it would have been easy but searching multiple files with multiple words was a task
I figured I have to use `grep -rilwE "holy.*good|good.*holy"` after alot of searching

### There After

The next problem was that my mac wasn't updated so it had missing files which were needed for dynamic terminal
I got it to work after two days.
I had searched for all the files through the realms so once my Terminal started working it was a matter of minutes to victory

Decoding was fun, and I got the link to God Suite repo
It was a straight road from there
Finally, after defeating monsters and seeing stars I got Victory
