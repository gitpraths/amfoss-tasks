This file is details about my journey to victory.

### Part 1:
I found the first code with ease.
Three new commands that I learnt:
- `tree`: gives the structure of the directories and subdirectories of the main directory
- `find`: searches the directories and subdirectories and tells you the exact location of the file
- `cat`: reads the contents of a txt/sh files
### Part 2:
This is where I got stuck and boy it was frustrating.
One new command that I learnt:
- `grep`: using `grep -rl` gives you the names of files with the given word in command
If it would have been one word, it would have been easy but searching multiple files with multiple words was a task
I figured I have to use `grep -rilwE "holy.*good|good.*holy"` after alot of searching

### Oh No

The next problem was that my mac wasn't updated so it had missing files which were needed for dynamic terminal
I got it to work after two days.
I had searched for all the files through the realms so once my Terminal started working it was a matter of hours to victory

### Part 3:

I knew the location to chest1.py and chest2.py so used `python3 nameoffile.py` and got the remaining two codes
### Part 4:
With the help of `base64 -d <<<"base64_encoded_string"` command, I was able to decode the codes and got the link to God-Suite repo

### Part 5:
I went through all the commits and found the encoded code in third commit
With the help of `base64 -d <<<"base64_encoded_string"` command, I was able to decode the codes and got the link to `to-see....` repo

Finally, after defeating monsters and seeing stars I got Victory
