This repository contains code for Telegram Bot made using Python.
The mistake I made while working on this task was not reading the instructing properly. I made Telegram Bot made using Java. I read the instructions for the list of commands needed and realised that the bot was suppoed to be made using python. <br>
It was a stupid mistake but because I had already done it once in Java (till a certain point), recreating it in Python was fairly easy. 
It was an interesting task for sure.
