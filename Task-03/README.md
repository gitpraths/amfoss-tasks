## Approach
I didn't want to sit and learn atleast six new programming lanuages along with eight other very lengthy task. <br>
I started with one lanuage at a time and went throught it's basic on W3Schools or TutorialPoint like websites.
I learnt what was necessary for tasks:
1. print statements
2. reading a file
3. creating basic patterns
4. reading and printing said data
5. how to run each file on VSC

It was a lengthy. Google was my best friend.
