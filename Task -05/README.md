### Here is everything I learnt
This task was very interesting. I have been learning about web dev since a year but I never used an API to build a website.
When I saw the first saw the task, I thought I had to build a simple html website for the store and then use the API to do the list of tasks given.
It was way more complicated than that
I started with building the terminal on html and then added basic css to make it look appealing
Next I started to work on the JS script which was the hero of the website. 
It took 2.5 days to finish the complete project.
I learnt ALOT of new things (basic idea for program):
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- how to use Local Storage to store and return data
- Searching and Sorting codes
- to switch between pages without actually linking them

### Working of the Store

- `list`: list all the products on the right of terminal
- `deails <productid>`: details info about that specific product
- `add <productid>`: adds the product to the cart
- `remove <productid>`: removes the product from the cart
- `cart`: displays all the current items in cart
- `buy`: displays the cart items with bill summary aka checkout page
- `clear`: clears the terminal screen
- `search <item>`: searches the item by title
- `sort price`/ `sort name`: sorts the items by the given criteria
