## The link to Blog
My favourite task was The Terminal Chaos and it was a great experience. <br>
The reason why I loved working on it was that I love puzzles and this was my first technical one. <br>
This is my first blog, and I'm looking forward to sharing it with you. I hope you enjoy the read.<br>
